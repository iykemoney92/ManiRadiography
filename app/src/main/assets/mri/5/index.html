  <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest uses a powerful magnetic field, radio waves and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the structures within the chest. It is primarily used to assess abnormal masses such as cancer and determine the size, extent and degree of its spread to adjacent structures. Itâ€™s also used to assess the anatomy and function of the heart and its blood flow.</div><div class="panel" style="

  <h4><b>Uses</b></h4><ul><li>assess abnormal masses, including cancer of the lungs or other tissues, which either cannot be assessed adequately with other imaging modalities (typically CT) or which are particularly well-suited to MR imaging.</li><li>
determine tumor size, extent, and the degree of spread to adjacent structures.</li><li>
assess the anatomy and function of the heart and its component structures (valves, etc.).</li><li>
assess myocardial perfusion (blood flow to the heart) and myocardial infarct (scar in the heart muscle due to prior obstruction of blood flow).</li><li>
determine blood flow dynamics in the vessels and heart chambers.</li><li>
display lymph nodes and blood vessels, including vascular and lymphatic malformations of the chest.</li><li>
assess disorders of the chest bones (vertebrae, ribs and sternum) and chest wall soft tissue (muscles and fat).</li><li>
assess for pericardial (thin sac around the heart) disease.
characterize mediastinal or pleural lesions seen by other imaging modalities, such as chest x-ray or CT.</li></ul></div><div class="panel" style="
