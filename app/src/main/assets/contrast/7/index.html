 <h4>Introduction</h4>
 <p>is a radiologic procedure to investigate the shape of the uterine cavity and the shape and patency of the fallopian tubes. It entails the injection of a radio-opaque material into the cervical canal and usually fluoroscopy with image intensification. A normal result shows the filling of the uterine cavity and the bilateral filling of the fallopian tube with the injection material. To demonstrate tubal rupture, spillage of the material into the peritoneal cavity needs to be observed.</p>

 <h4>Indications</h4><ul><li>Hysterosalpingography is primarily used to examine women who have difficulty becoming pregnant by allowing the radiologist to evaluate the shape and structure of the uterus, the openness of the fallopian tubes, and any scarring within the uterine or peritoneal (abdominal) cavity.</li><li>The procedure can be used to investigate repeated miscarriages that result from congenital or acquired abnormalities of the uterus and to determine the presence and severity of these abnormalities, including:
<ul><li>Tumor masses</li><li>
Adhesions</li><li>
  Uterine fibroids</li></ul></li><li>
Hysterosalpingography is also used to evaluate the openness of the fallopian tubes, and to monitor the effects of tubal surgery, including:
<ul><li>
  Blockage of the fallopian tubes due to infection or scarring</li><li>
Tubal ligation</li><li>
The closure of the fallopian tubes in a sterilization procedure and a sterilization reversal</li><li>
  The re-opening of the fallopian tubes following a sterilization or disease-related blockage</li></ul></li></ul>

<h4>Procedure</h4><ul><li>This examination is usually done on an outpatient basis.
  </li><li>
The procedure is like a gynecological exam. The patient is positioned on her back on the exam table, with her knees bent or her feet held up with stirrups and a speculum is inserted into the vagina. The cervix is then cleansed, and a catheter is inserted into the cervix. The speculum is removed and the patient is carefully positioned underneath the fluoroscopy camera. The contrast material then begins to fill the uterine cavity, fallopian tubes and peritoneal cavity through the catheter and fluoroscopic images are taken.
</li><li>
In some cases, if certain abnormalities are encountered, the patient will be asked to rest and wait up to 30 minutes so that a delayed image can be obtained. This delayed image may provide clues to a patient's condition that the original images with contrast material do not. On occasion, an x-ray will be taken the next day to ensure that there is no scarring surrounding the ovaries.
</li><li>
When the procedure is complete, the catheter will be removed and the patient will be allowed to sit up.
</li><li>
When the examination is complete, you may be asked to wait until the radiologist determines that all the necessary images have been obtained.
</li><li>
  The hysterosalpingogram is usually completed within 30 minutes.</li></ul>
