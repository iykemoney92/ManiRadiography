 <h4>Introduction</h4>
 <p>is the test where dyes that can be seen by x-rays are injected into blood vessels (either arteries or veins) and examined using x-rays. The resulting pictures are called angiograms. Angiograms are used to diagnose narrowing or blockages in vessels anywhere in the body, from head to toe, including:
<ul><li>
The arteries feeding the heart muscle</li><li>
The arteries going to the brain</li><li>
The arteries feeding the arms and legs</li><li>
The arteries feeding the kidneys</li><li>
All of the vessels going to and coming from the lungs</li></ul>
In addition to finding narrowing and blockages, angiography can also be used to find places where the arteries or veins are bulging or ballooning. These spots are called aneurysms and if not treated, can cause death when they rupture.</p>

 <h4>Indications</h4>
 <ul><li>
  identify abnormalities, such as aneurysms, in the aorta, both in the chest and abdomen, or in other arteries.</li><li>
detect atherosclerotic (plaque) disease in the carotid artery of the neck, which may limit blood flow to the brain 
and cause a stroke.</li><li>
identify a small aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (abnormal communications between blood vessels) 
inside the brain or other parts of the body.</li><li>
detect atherosclerotic disease that has narrowed the arteries to the legs and help prepare for 
endovascular intervention or surgery.</li><li>
detect disease in the arteries to the kidneys or visualize blood flow to help prepare for a kidney transplant.</li><li>
guide interventional radiologists and surgeons making repairs to diseased blood vessels, 
such as implanting stents or evaluating a stent after implantation.</li><li>
detect injury to one or more arteries in the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis or extremities in patients after trauma.</li><li>
evaluate arteries feeding a tumor prior to surgery or other procedures such as 
chemoembolization or selective internal radiation therapy.</li><li>
identify dissection or splitting in the aorta in the chest or abdomen or its major branches.</li><li>
show the extent and severity of the effects of coronary artery disease 
and plan for a surgical operation, such as a coronary bypass and stenting.</li><li>
examine pulmonary arteries in the lungs to detect pulmonary embolism 
(blood clots, such as those traveling from leg veins) or pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.</li><li>
look at congenital abnormalities in blood vessels, especially arteries in children 
(e.g., malformations in the heart or other blood vessels due to congenital heart disease).</li><li>
evaluate obstructions of vessels.</li></ul>

<h4>Procedure</h4>
  In order to do an angiogram, the patient is taken into a special procedure room. Oftentimes these rooms will have a setup similar to this one:

Cardiac Catheterization Room
Cardiac Catheterization Room
In the picture, you can see the bed where the patient will be placed and the c-arm that produces the x-rays that then are digitally transmitted to the set of screens on the other side of the patient bed. At some point prior to procedure, the patient's groin or area above the elbow is clipped or shaved and then cleaned with a surgical prep solution. Sterile drapes are then placed to help ensure that bacteria are not introduced directly into the patient's blood stream.

Oftentimes, the patient is given fluids and some medication through an IV to help him or her relax during the procedure. Monitors for blood pressure, the heart's electrical activity, and blood oxygen levels are also placed so that medical personnel in the room can keep an eye on the patient's condition. A thin tube called a sheath is then placed in a major blood vessel (aka the access site) to allow the doctor to place different catheters into the vessels of interest and inject dye. As the dye is injected, the patient may get a warm flushed feeling in the body part being examined.

In this picture (below), you can see the catheter has been threaded up through the femoral artery which goes to the lower part of the aorta, which is the major artery coming out of the heart. The physician can then inject dye and see the outline of the aorta under x-ray to check for narrowing or aneurysms.
