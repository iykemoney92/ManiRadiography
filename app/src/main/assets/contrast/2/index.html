 <h4>Introduction</h4>
 <p>Intravenous urography (IVU), also referred as intravenous pyelography (IVP) or excretory urography (EU), is a radiographic study of the renal parenchyma, pelvicalyceal system, ureters and the urinary bladder. This exam has been largely replaced by CT urography.

 <h4>Indications</h4><ul><li>
 check for normal function of kidneys</li><li>
check for anatomical variants or congenital anomalies (e.g. horse-shoe kidney)</li><li>
check the course of the ureters</li><li>
detect and localise a ureteric obstruction (urolithiasis)</li><li>
assess for synchronous upper tract disease in those with bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC)</li></ul>

<h4>Procedure</h4>
  <b>Patient Preparation</b>:
  <ul><li>
  overnight fasting prior to the date of examination; a laxative would help to achieve a good preparation</li><li>
on the day of procedure take a scout/pilot film to check patient preparation and also for radio-opaque calculi</li><li>
check serum creatinine level to be within normal range (as per hospital guidelines)</li><li>
take a history of the patient for any known drug allergies followed by a written informed consent for the procedure</li></ul>
  
  <b>Technique</b>:
  <ul><li>
  Exposures are generally in the 65-75 kV range, mA of 600-1000, with exposure of < 0.1 sec. Higher kV ranges reduce contrast of the renal parenchyma.
  </li><li>

IV access is required for administration of a water soluble contrast
nonionic contrast is preferred</li><li>
dose will vary as per the weight of the patient; generally up to 1.5 ml/kg body weight is well tolerated by patient</li><li>
the contrast dose is usually instilled at a fast (bolus) rate </li><li>
the calyces are usually visualized in <2 minutes following contrast administration - this is the nephrogram</li><li>
serial images are taken at 5-20 minutes for visualisation of the pelvicalyceal systems and ureters when required and with operator preference</li><li>
additional views taken are prone and obliques for ureters</li><li>
the full length 10-15 minute film is performed with a compression band applied to the patient</li><li>
compression should not be applied if ureteral calculi, ureteral obstruction, recent surgery, nephrostomy, or abdominal aortic aneurysm is suspected</li><li>
lastly take a full bladder and post void film</li></ul>
There is a wide variation in protocols. One protocol is suggested below, but additional images should usually be obtained to answer the clinical question:
<ul><li>
Scout images</li><li>
(1-2 minutes) Nephrogram</li><li>
(>3 minutes) Early and late images of the upper collecting system (abdominal compression then applied)</li><li>
Tomography may be obtained, if desired</li><li>
(10-15 minutes) Supine, after release of compression, images of the upper collecting system and proximal ureters</li><li>
(20 minute) Supine image</li><li>
(20 minute) Prone image</li><li>
Emergency medications and emergency equipment must always be available in case the patient has a reaction to contrast.</li></ul>
