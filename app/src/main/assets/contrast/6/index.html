 <h4>Introduction</h4>
 <p>A myelogram is a diagnostic imaging procedure done by a radiologist/radiographer. It uses a contrast dye and X-rays or computed tomography (CT) to look for problems in the spinal canal, including the spinal cord, nerve roots, and other tissues. It is also known as myelography<br>

The contrast dye is injected into the spinal column before the procedure. The contrast dye appears on an X-ray screen, allowing the radiologist to see the spinal cord, subarachnoid space, and other nearby structures more clearly than with standard X-rays of the spine.<br>

The radiologist/radiographer will also use a CT scan when doing a myelogram. A CT or CAT scan is a diagnostic imaging procedure using a combination of X-rays and computer technology to produce horizontal, or axial, images of the body. These images, called slices, show detailed images of the spinal canal. CT scans provide more detail than standard X-rays.</p>

 <h4>Indications</h4><ul><li>Herniated discs (discs that bulge and press on nerves and/or the spinal cord)</li><li>Spinal cord or brain tumors</li><li>

Infection and/or inflammation of tissues around the spinal cord and brain</li><li>

Spinal stenosis (degeneration and swelling of the bones and tissue around the spinal cord that make the canal narrow)</li><li>

Ankylosing spondylitis (a disease that affects the spine, causing bones to grow together)</li><li>

Bone spurs</li><li>

Arthritis discs</li><li>

Degenerative disc disease </li><li>

Cysts (benign capsules that may be filled with fluid)</li><li>

Tearing away or injury of spinal nerve roots</li><li>

Arachnoiditis (inflammation of a delicate membrane covering the brain)</li></ul>

<h4>Procedure</h4><ul><li>
  During the procedure, the patient will lie on your stomach on a padded table.</li><li>

Back will be cleaned with an antiseptic solution and draped with sterile towels.</li><li>

The radiologist will numb the skin by injecting a local anesthetic that numbs the site. This injection may sting for a few seconds, but makes the procedure less painful.</li><li>

A needle will be inserted through the numbed skin and into the subarachnoid space where the spinal fluid is located.</li><li>

The radiologist will remove some of the spinal fluid from the spinal canal. Next, a portion of contrast dye will be injected into the spinal canal through the needle. </li><li>

The X-ray table will be tilted in various directions to allow gravity to move the contrast dye to different areas of your spinal cord. The patient will be held in place by a special brace or harness. More contrast may be given during this process through the secured lumbar puncture needle.</li><li>

The needle is removed and the X-rays or CT scan pictures are taken.
  </li></ul>
