 <h4>Introduction</h4>
 <p>A barium enema is an X-ray exam that can detect changes or abnormalities in the large intestine (colon). The procedure is also called a colon X-ray.
<br><br>
An enema is the injection of a liquid into your rectum through a small tube. In this case, the liquid contains a metallic substance (barium) that coats the lining of the colon. Normally, an X-ray produces a poor image of soft tissues, but the barium coating results in a relatively clear silhouette of the colon.
<br><br>
During a barium enema exam, air may be pumped into the colon. The air expands the colon and improves the quality of images. This is called an air-contrast (double-contrast) barium enema.

<h4>Procedure</h4><ul><li>A barium enema typically takes between 30 and 60 minutes and is performed at a hospital or specialized testing facility. The patient changes into a hospital gown and remove any jewelry or other metal from the body. </li><li>

Patient will be positioned on an exam table. X-rays will be taken to ensure that your bowels are clear. This may also involve a physical rectal exam.</li><li>

The radiologist will then insert a small tube into the rectum and introduce the barium and water mixture. The radiologist may gently push air into the colon after the barium has been delivered in order to allow for even more detailed X-ray images. This is called an air-contrast barium enema.</li><li>

The radiographer instructs patient to hold still and hold breath while the X-ray images are taken. Repositioning several times to take pictures of the colon from different angles may be neccessary.</li><li>

After the procedure, the majority of the barium and water will be removed through the tube. The patient passes out the rest in the bathroom.</li></ul>
