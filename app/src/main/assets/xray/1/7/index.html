"><strong>Picture Archive and Communications System(PACS)</strong><p>
PACS is an image-management and communication system. It
stores and distributes images and information around the system.
It is connected to each of the digital acquisition systems and
other modalities in order that images and information can be
transmitted to their appropriate destinations. Patient data from
the HIS/RIS system are used to correctly route and retrieve
images, and printers are used to produce hard copy if needed.
A PACS can range from so-called ‘mini-PACS’ systems serving
just one or two imaging modalities with perhaps only one reporting
workstation to enterprise-wide PACS handling all image data
with multiple reporting and speciality workstations and image
distribution to all necessary locations throughout the hospital and
beyond. There are many PACS models.
Images will be viewed at various points in the system. The
extent to which these images can be manipulated will depend on
the type and function of the equipment. Typical viewing components
include:<br/>
• acquisition, reporting and viewing workstations;<br/>
• monitors;</br>
• laser printers.</br></p></div>
