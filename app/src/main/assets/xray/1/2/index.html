"><li>
  <strong>Antero-posterior(AP)</strong></li><li> The central ray is incident on the anterior aspect (front of patient), passes along
or parallel to the median sagittal plane , and emerges from the
posterior aspect (back of patient) of the body.</li><li>
  <strong>Postero-anterior(PA)</strong></li><li>The central ray is incident on the posterior aspect (back of the patient), passes along
or parallel to the median sagittal plane, and emerges from the
anterior aspect (front of patient) of the body.</li><li>
  <strong>Lateral</strong></li><li>The central ray passes from one side of the body to the other
along a coronal and transverse plane. The projection is called a
right lateral if the central ray enters the body on the left side and
passes through to the image receptor positioned on the right
side. A left lateral is achieved if the central ray enters the body
on the right side and passes through to the image receptor,
which will be positioned parallel to the median sagittal plane on
the left side of the body.</li>
<hr><li><strong>Beam angulation</strong></li>
<li>Radiographic projections are often modified by directing the
central ray at some angle to a transverse plane, i.e. either caudally
(angled towards the feet) or cranially/cephalic angulation
(angled towards the head). The projection is then described as,
for example, a lateral 20° caudad or a lateral 15°
  cephalad.</li>
<li><strong>Oblique</strong></li>
<li>The central ray passes through the body along a transverse plane at
some angle between the median sagittal and coronal planes. For
this projection, the patient is usually positioned with the median
sagittal plane at some angle between zero and 90° to the
cassette, with the central ray at right-angles to the cassette. If the
patient is positioned with the median sagittal plane at right-angles
to or parallel to the cassette, then the projection is obtained by
  directing the central ray at some angle to the median sagittal plane.</li>
<li><strong>Anterior oblique(AP-Oblique)</strong></li>
<li>
The central ray enters the posterior aspect, passes along a transverse
plane at some angle to the median sagittal plane, and
emerges from the anterior aspect. The projection is also described
by the side of the torso closest to the cassette. In the diagram
below, the left side is closest to the cassette, and therefore the
projection is a described as a left anterior oblique.
</li>
<li><strong>Posterior oblique(PA-Oblique)</strong></li>
<li>The central ray enters the anterior aspect, passes along a transverse
plane at some angle to the median sagittal plane, and
emerges from the posterior aspect. Again, the projection is
described by the side of the torso closest to the cassette. The
  diagram below shows a left posterior oblique.</li>
<li><strong>Lateral oblique</strong></li>
<li>The central ray enters one lateral aspect, passes along a transverse
plane at an angle to the coronal plane, and emerges from
the opposite lateral aspect.
With the coronal plane at right-angles to the cassette, lateral
oblique projections can also be obtained by angling the central
  ray to the coronal plane.</li></ul></div>
