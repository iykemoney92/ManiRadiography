  <strong>Milliampere seconds</strong></li><li>This indicates the intensity or, put simply, the amount of radiation
being used. If the radiation has enough energy to penetrate
the body, then it will be detected by the image-acquisition
device and will determine the image density or, again put simply,
the image ‘blackening’.
mAs is a product of the X-ray tube current (mA) and exposure
time (seconds). As a general rule, the mA should be as high
as possible with a short time, to reduce the risk of movement
unsharpness.</li><li>
  <strong>Kilovoltage</strong></li><li>This indicates how the X-ray beam will penetrate the body. The
range of kilovoltages used in diagnostic radiography is normally
between 50 and 120 kVp, although a kilovoltage as low as 25 kVp
may be used for certain soft-tissue examinations, such as mammography.
High-kVp techniques, such as those used in chest
radiography, employ a kilovoltage in excess of 120 kVp.
The kilovoltage will have a profound effect on the image
density.</li>

<li><strong>Focus-to-film distance</strong></li>


<li>For a given kVp and mAs, the greater the FFD, the lower the
intensity of radiation reaching the film. Therefore, to obtain the
same film blackening, if the FFD is increased the mAs must also
be increased.</li>
