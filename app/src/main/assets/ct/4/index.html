  <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>Computed tomography (CT) of the spine is a diagnostic imaging test used to help diagnose—or rule out—spinal column damage in injured patients. CT scanning is fast, painless, noninvasive and accurate. In emergency cases, it can reveal internal injuries and bleeding quickly enough to help save lives.</div><div class="panel" style="
    padding: 1%;

  CT scanning of the spine is also performed to:
<br><ul><li>
  assess spine fractures due to injury.</li><li>
evaluate the spine before and after surgery.</li><li>
help diagnose spinal pain. One of the most common causes of spinal pain that may be diagnosed by CT is a herniated intervertebral disk. Occasionally, this diagnosis is made using CT myelography.</li><li>
accurately measure bone density in the spine and predict whether vertebral fractures are likely to occur in patients who are at risk of osteoporosis.</li><li>
assess for congenital anomalies of the spine or scoliosis.</li><li>
detect various types of tumors in the vertebral column, including those that have spread there from another area of the body. Some tumors that arise elsewhere are first identified by finding deposits of malignant cells (metastases) in the vertebrae; prostate cancer is an example.</li><li>
guide diagnostic procedures such as the biopsy of a suspicious area to detect cancer, or the removal of fluid from a localized infection (abscess).</li></ul></div>
