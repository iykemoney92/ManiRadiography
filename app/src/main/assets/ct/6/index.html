  <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>Computed tomography angiography (CTA) uses an injection of iodine-rich contrast material and CT scanning to help diagnose and evaluate blood vessel disease or related conditions, such as aneurysms or blockages.</div><div class="panel" style="

  <h4><b>Uses</b></h4>
Chest CT can demonstrate various lung disorders, such as:
Physicians use this test to diagnose and evaluate many diseases of blood vessels and related conditions such as:
<br><ul><li>
  injury</li><li>
aneurysms</li><li>
blockages (including those from blood clots or plaques)</li><li>
disorganized blood vessels and blood supply to tumors</li><li>
congenital (birth related) abnormalities of the heart, blood vessels or various parts of the body which might be supplied by abnormal blood vessels</li></ul>
Also, physicians use this exam to check blood vessels following surgery, such as:
<br><ul><li>
identify abnormalities, such as aneurysms, in the aorta, both in the chest and abdomen, or in other arteries.</li><li>
detect atherosclerotic (plaque) disease in the carotid artery of the neck, which may limit blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke.</li><li>
identify a small aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (abnormal communications between blood vessels) inside the brain or other parts of the body.<li>
detect atherosclerotic disease that has narrowed the arteries to the legs and help prepare for endovascular intervention or surgery.</li><li>
detect disease in the arteries to the kidneys or visualize blood flow to help prepare for a kidney transplant.</li><li>
guide interventional radiologists and surgeons making repairs to diseased blood vessels, such as implanting stents or evaluating a stent after implantation.</li><li>
detect injury to one or more arteries in the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis or extremities in patients after trauma.</li><li>
evaluate arteries feeding a tumor prior to surgery or other procedures such as chemoembolization or selective internal radiation therapy.</li><li>
identify dissection or splitting in the aorta in the chest or abdomen or its major branches.</li><li>
show the extent and severity of the effects of coronary artery disease and plan for a surgical operation, such as a coronary bypass and stenting.</li><li>
examine pulmonary arteries in the lungs to detect pulmonary embolism (blood clots, such as those traveling from leg veins) or pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.</li><li>
look at congenital abnormalities in blood vessels, especially arteries in children (e.g., malformations in the heart or other blood vessels due to congenital heart disease).</li><li>
  evaluate obstructions of vessels.</li></li></ul></div><div class="panel" style="
